# EhUI

**Eh**an's **UI** Kit

TODO NOW:
- mobile header
  - add `position: static` to `header` as an option to "hide header"
    - no, it doesn't effect its width
    - make that option `static` default on mobile
    - make `sticky` default on desktop
    - the setting thingy will be under `options` which will toggle between letting the header scroll with the page or stay at the top
- javascript-localstorage-save options (like disableanimations & the new hideornohidetheheader)
  - just like with the theme-save-and-load localstorage thingy
- document usage of `i`/italic vs `b`/bold in writing
- `<a>` has its own size, breaks `.h1`, `.h2`, etc
- `<code>` has its own size, breaks `.h1`, `.h2`, etc
- `layouts.css`
  - `thingwrapthing` that uses `alignthing` should be `thingalignthing`
  - `thingthing` that uses `justifything` should be `thingjustifything`
  - correct justify and align use in class names
- fix margin(s)
  - temporary fix for `p`, labelled `/* TEMPORARY FIX */` in `components.css`
- autocomplete/autofill colors
- make sure tab works on file inputs
- styleguide
  - & specifically **camelCase**
  - consistant image alt tag (+ and in quizfreely)
    - currently most are `<img ... alt="image" ...`
  - fix incorrect `<br/>`, and encorage correct `<br/>` use in examples & actual html

TODO EXTRA:
- fancy betterthantab keyboard shortcut system

NOTE:
- logos should use `--gray` not `--bg2`
