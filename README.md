# EhUI

so like i wrote css, but then i needed to use it again, so i dumped all of it here

then i needed more customizability and themes, so its in scss now, scss/sass is super epic and based and a massive w,

so anyway basically this is my "ui kit"/"ui library" with a bunch of useful css styles for almost everything my projects need so that i dont have to retype the same css. also its themeable and customizable, its used in like quizfreely and a bunch of other random stuff

yea its pretty epic ig, but its also unorganized like how rn the readme says this instead of idk something more fancy
