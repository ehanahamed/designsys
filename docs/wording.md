# Wording

## Grammar and capitalization

A button with really short text, like "Sign Up", should have "title capitalization", all words are capitalized except conjunctions. A button with longer text like a sentence, for example "Continue without an account" should have "sentence capitalization", you capitalize it like you would capitalize a normal sentence. However, do not use puncuation.

The above logic also applies to titles/headings (h2, h3, etc), if the text is short, like "Get Started", its "title capitalization", if its longer, like "Create or open a dataset". Titles also do not use _normal_ puncuation, however titles that are questions should use a question mark! Some titles might have commas, but almost never use periods at the end of titles.

Text/content should almost ALWAYS use proper grammar and capitalization.

## Styling text

Feel free to use bold (`<b>`) to indicate important text, and bg3 (`<span class="bg3">`) to make less important text stand out less. However, do not use both in one paragraph with no "normal" text.

## Source code

Source code should not use tenses (when possible), for example, a flippable/double-sided card is named `card double`, the name is "tenseless", the class to make the card flipped is named `flip`, NOT "flipped", the english language has a lot of odd and irregular tense conjugations for different words, so its simplier to juse use them like this, at least in the source code. In the actual website content, you should always use correct grammar.

### Center vs middle

In the source code, `center` should refer to centered alignment, like text-align, which way content floats, etc.

`middle` should be used when there are many options like left right and middle. Like in a grid layout, lets say there is three grid areas, one would be left right and middle, NOT center.

## UX/UI

The actual UI, unlike the source code, should always use correct grammar and should use correct tenses.

### Remove vs delete

"Remove" should mean that you are taking something out of somewhere, but the something you are removing still exists somewhere else. For example, if there is a list and there is a button to take something out of the list, that button would say "remove". You are re-_move_-ing something, that something still exists, but is just somewhere else.

"Delete" should mean that the something is being gone-ed. For example, if there is a textbox, and you are deleteing the textbox, and any content inside it (the textbox would be gone, not moved somewhere else, just gone completly) that button would be labeled "delete".

It doesn't matter if the action is undo-able, if it is gone-ed it is "delete"-ed, if it is moved out of something it is "remove"-ed.

## Sign Up, Log In, & Sign In

I use "sign up" and "sign in", cause they're the same first word and "look better". Theres really no logic to this preference, it just looks nicer to read.

## Pages vs Screens

Pages are scrollable with many things on them, screens have one main breif thing on them. Screens are full-height and do not scroll. Pages scroll.
